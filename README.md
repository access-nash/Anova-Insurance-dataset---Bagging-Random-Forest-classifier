# Anova-Insurance-dataset---Bagging-Random-Forest-classifier
The analysis below is for the same dataset as seen earlier where we had done the classification using the KNN model, the Logistic regression model and a Decision Tree classifier. This time I will use some homogeneous ensemble models using Bagging and Random Forest classifier and compare that with the Decision Tree classifier.
